				<h2 >My profession</h2>
				<p>Thanks for visiting my website, once again I'm james i did my bacheler degree as a engineer in the department of mechanical engineering, in the begining of my career i was not much intrested in coding but i had good thoughts in designing the machine elements and anlysing their properties, but later on i was supposed to do some small projects regarding to my work  basis it's a big  challenge for me because... before of that i didn't learn much things about coding but i worked for that and also learned few things and finally i got the solution as well then only i interested to do something in coding then only i started to learn more things in programming side for learning this i choose the platform Udemy which helps myself to grow and learn in deep, this is the small roadmap about my professional way '<strong>Just overcome the limitations</strong>'  </p>
